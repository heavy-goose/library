# 📚 Library Project

This is my version of the [Library project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library) from **The Odin Project** curriculum. It’s a small web app that lets users manage a personal library – a great way to practice DOM manipulation, object constructors, and event-driven logic.

## ✨ Features

- ➕ **Add new books** with title, author, number of pages, and read status  
- 🔁 **Toggle read status** for each book  
- ❌ **Remove books** from the collection  

## 🔍 What I Practiced

- 📦 **Modular JavaScript** using the module pattern to keep code clean and organized  
- 🧹 Focused on **clean, readable** code and **separation of concerns**  
- 🎯 Used constructor functions and object-based logic for book creation and library state management

## 🛠️ Built With

- 🧱 HTML5  
- 🎨 Vanilla CSS  
- ⚙️ Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

## Improvements

- 💾 Data is stored in memory (no backend or localStorage yet)
